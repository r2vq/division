# Division

A simple tool to learn React.
This particular practice session is an app to split the cost of expenses between friends/family.

# How it works

Having a dinner party?
Are different people bringing different things?
Is everyone still splitting everything or most things evenly?
Then this app is for you!

## Create an event

Create an event and list the people that will be splitting the bill.
Include the people that spent any money even if they aren't pitching in.

## Add items

Add the items that people are pitching in for.
Make sure to include the person that spent the money.
If everyone is pitching in for that item, keep the split default.
Otherwise, choose custom split and uncheck anyone that isn't chipping in.
